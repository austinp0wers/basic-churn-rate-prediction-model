# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview

Welcome to our Customer Churn Prediction Model repository! ðŸš€ Here, i've built a cool machine learning model that predicts **when** customers might decide to take a break from our service. We got inspired by some insights from the CEO of Toss, a fintech superstar, who showed us how knowing when customers might leave can help keep our business sailing smoothly.

## Model Description

The churn prediction model in this repository leverages machine learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of customer churn based on historical data. The model utilizes supervised learning algorithms and features such as demographics, transactional behavior, and engagement metrics to make predictions. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to optimize predictive performance.

## Usage

To utilize the churn prediction model:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical customer data, ensuring it encompasses relevant features for churn prediction.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables. Ensure the dataset is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Model Training**: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the churn prediction model using algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or ROC-AUC.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can generate real-time predictions on new customer data. Integrate the model into business workflows to facilitate decision-making processes.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for neural network implementation, optional)

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the model's accuracy, efficiency, or generalizability are welcomed. Suggestions for feature engineering, algorithm selection, or model evaluation methods are valuable contributions. Please follow best practices for code documentation, testing, and submission guidelines when contributing.
